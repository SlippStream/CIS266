SA
1. Multiline
2. Single-line
3. Widening conversion is when a lower-level variable is converted to a higher-level type, and vice versa.
4. Case-Sensitive means that whether a letter is upper or lower case is important in deciding its meaning.
5. print and println are members of the out class which is a member of the System class
6. Must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, cannot have spaces, and must have at least one character.
7. println is just print that skips a line after printing.
8. How much memory a type uses and what you'll be doing with it.
9. Initialization makes a spot for it in memory, and assignment gives it a value.
10. // comments are single-line whereas /* comments are Multiline
11. Programming style is the focus that your programs are built with. Interchanging them can lead to messy and inconsistent code.
12. The actual value can be changed in a single statement.
